## Decision

compliancekit uses Bun 1.3.14 as its canonical JavaScript package manager and targets Node 24+ in CI. Legacy npm lockfile paths are ignored to prevent `npm ci` drift.

## Verification

- CI uses Bun installation rather than `npm ci`.
- Package metadata, README guidance, and workflow runtime requirements agree.
- Existing dependency majors are retained unless a tested compatibility migration is available.
