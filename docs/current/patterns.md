- [Primary workflows](#primary-workflows)
- [Recovery behavior](#recovery-behavior)
- [Verification](#verification)

## Primary workflows

1. Authenticate, scan an input stream, review masked findings, then queue remediation work.
2. Use custom rules for approved detection patterns and review analytics before creating a report job.

## Recovery behavior

Show actionable errors, preserve safe user input where possible, and explain the next recovery action. For destructive or irreversible actions, require confirmation and document the available undo or export path.

## Verification

- Exercise a happy path, an empty state, a validation error, and a recovery path.
- Confirm instructions match visible labels and current API/UI behavior.
