## Non-negotiable rules

- Keep product claims tied to shipped source, tests, or clearly labelled evidence.
- Preserve safe defaults and make consequential actions explicit.
- Keep current guidance separate from historical logs and release evidence.

## Accessibility baseline

- Every interactive control needs a programmatic label, visible keyboard focus, and a target size appropriate for its context.
- Do not communicate status by color alone; include text, icon, or state labels.
- Support reduced motion and explain loading, empty, error, and disabled states in workflow documentation.

## Content rules

Use task-first headings, concrete verification steps, and one source of truth per current topic. Mark unknowns as gaps instead of inferring them.

## Verification

- Review a changed interface with keyboard navigation and visible focus.
- Check that a reader can find the relevant workflow from [Start here](start-here.md).
