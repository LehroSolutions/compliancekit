- [Documentation gate](#documentation-gate)
- [Definition of done](#definition-of-done)

## Required gates

1. Run the appropriate product command: `python -m py_compile webapp/server.py`.
2. Run focused tests for changed behavior.
3. Inspect relevant empty, loading, error, disabled, desktop, and narrow-width UI states.
4. Record evidence without turning historical output into current product guidance.

## Documentation gate

`pnpm docs:build` regenerates reader, agent, portal, map, and release-manifest artifacts from canonical documentation. `pnpm docs:check` fails when counterpart, metadata, checksum, or navigation contracts are not satisfied.

## Definition of done

- The code, workflow, architecture, security, and quality docs agree.
- Every current canonical guide has Markdown, HTML, and JSON counterparts.
- Local links and counterpart metadata validate.
- The public README links to the current Documentation Home.
